# ArtiGuard: NFT Integrity Sentinel

ArtiGuard is a groundbreaking project designed to protect the integrity of NFT artworks, empowering artists to combat intellectual property theft effectively. Leveraging neural networks, ArtiGuard detects plagiarism of NFT ERC1155 tokens directly within the blockchain. Users can verify the originality of artworks by purchasing certifications through our DAPP, accessible via the Rinkeby test network. Our oracle validates the NFT and records its originality score on the smart contract. The originality scores of each certified painting are stored on the ArtiGuard contract, enabling everyone to view an artwork and check its originality score.

## Inspiration

ArtiGuard draws inspiration from the need to safeguard the intellectual property rights of NFT artists. The project aims to address the rising concern of plagiarism in the NFT space by providing a robust solution for detecting and preventing unauthorized use of digital artworks.

## What it does

ArtiGuard utilizes neural networks to detect plagiarism of NFT ERC1155 tokens directly within the blockchain. Users can verify the originality of artworks by purchasing certifications through our DAPP, accessible via the Rinkeby test network. Our oracle validates the NFT and records its originality score on the smart contract. The originality scores of each certified painting are stored on the ArtiGuard contract, enabling everyone to view an artwork and check its originality score.

## How we built it

Our solution for plagiarism detection is inspired by Content-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR). We employ a three-step approach:
1. Training feature extractor (utilizing a pre-trained ResNet50 model).
2. Indexing dataset (implemented via nmslib).
3. Searching for the best matches (also via nmslib).

## Challenges we ran into

One of the main challenges we encountered was the need for accurate and efficient plagiarism detection algorithms within the blockchain environment. We overcame this challenge by leveraging neural networks and implementing a robust feature extraction and comparison process.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud to have developed a comprehensive solution that addresses the critical issue of plagiarism in the NFT space. Our project combines cutting-edge technology with a user-friendly interface, making it accessible to artists and collectors alike.

## What we learned

Through the development of ArtiGuard, we gained valuable insights into the complexities of intellectual property protection in the digital age. We also honed our skills in neural network development, blockchain integration, and user interface design.

## What's next for ArtiGuard

In the future, we plan to further enhance ArtiGuard's capabilities by incorporating additional features such as enhanced plagiarism detection algorithms, support for different blockchain networks, and integration with leading NFT marketplaces.
